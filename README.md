# Doorman

Doorman is a customer facing VPN service that gives access to their private subnets within their [Equinix Metal](https://metal.equinix.com/) environment.
It works by managing OpenVPN credentials/authorization and iptables rules.
All of the vpn tech is vanilla OpenVPN.

Creating login credentials for user:
Your OpenVPN configuration file can be found at /home/doorman-demo/oss-doorman/doorman-demo@equinix.com.ovpn
doorman-demo@doorman:~/oss-doorman$
```

OpenVPN and Doorman should be running now on your provisioned server. 
The contents of the OpenVPN configuration file will be what you use with your OpenVPN client. 
The username will be the email address you use to login to your Equinix Metal account. 
Your password will be the current six digit two factor authentication token prepended to your Equinix Metal password.

Password Example:
```
123456P@ssw0rd
```

To access the private IP addresses of instances in other facilities you must enable "Backend Transfer", which you'll find under the "IP & Networking" menu of the Equinix Metal Console for your project.
